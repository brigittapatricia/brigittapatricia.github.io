# Portfolio of Brigitta Patricia
This portfolio is a compilation of projects I have taken for my undergraduate and graduate studies.

## Graduate Project
A Python course final project in which my team was required to analyse a consulting company's annual employee performance bonuses. This program reads across several CSV files and extracts the data before calculating and determining the bonuses. The data that is extracted can be in a quantitative or qualitative form, or even both! For this project, I solely relied on IntelliJ IDEA. Here is a [link](https://github.com/brigittapatricia/Final-Project) to the code.

## Undergraduate Project
This is a Figma project where I built an Interactive Prototype Design for my university. The main functionality of this prototype is to show how powerful and handy it would be to have an application that can be used by every university member, showing diverse pages depending on each person's role in it.
